Untimed break between 3rd and 4th 2Ks. 3 minutes between the two speed-work sets at the end of the workout.

Consistency was present in overall splits, but below the surface, things felt inconsistent. As with last week's 1Ks, each 800 seem to be split (per 200) as 36-37/40/40/40. Initial 800 in each rep felt smooth, second 800 felt difficult after the 200 @ 5K. Had a stitch and pain in both quadricep tendons that slowly built up rep by rep to the point that I took an untimed break after the 3rd 2K to stretch and grab some electrolytes.

for those who are curious, the idea is to focus on moving from your elbows and not your hands/wrists with an even carriage. you can think of your arms like those swinging ships at amusement parks that have an even 50/50 swing left and right. you don’t wanna cross over your body to the other side but it is perfectly acceptable to swing up in front of the body towards the midline. it a important to feel the difference in your back/shoulders, hips, and feet when doing the new way versus your old way. this way you can make that neuromuscular connection and ensure you’re not falling back to your old way while practicing the cue. if you feel like you’re transitioning to your old way, don’t fight it and reset with your old form, then return to the cue shortly after. feel free to DM me if you have any questions! happy to help. also if you do want to work on your form, be sure to video yourself with a friend/tripod and phone on the road and get three clips: one running away from the camera, one towards, and one from the side at around waist level.",63,FALSE,4.776,598,0,12,4,1
