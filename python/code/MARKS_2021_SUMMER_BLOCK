2465,MARK M,Afternoon Run,"Had a lot of thinking to do after that and I think that was the worst race I have ever had. Going from low 17 to over 19 sophomore year districts was bad, going from 2:03 to 2:14 junior year indoor track was bad, and two mile to miss a chance to beat parkland junior were all quite bad but this one takes the cake. 1275 miles over 23 weeks to do that kinda sucked. But we bounce back. During this season I broke my two mile and 5k pr in workouts and crushed my season goal of 27:30. I‚Äôll put the feeling of this race in the same place as the others to use when I need a little push during workouts or when I don‚Äôt want to go out in the cold. I‚Äôve got 365 days to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen again. But first, track!",00:30:04,4.02,00:07:38,2021-11-08
