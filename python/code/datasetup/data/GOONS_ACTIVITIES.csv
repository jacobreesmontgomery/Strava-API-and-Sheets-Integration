See below for the workout design. Modifications/clarifications - 2 minutes between the initial speed-work and first 2K, between the 1st/2nd 2K and 2nd/3rd 2K, and between the 4th 2K and the beginning of final speed work. Untimed break between 3rd and 4th 2Ks. 3 minutes between the two speed-work sets at the end of the workout.

Consistency was present in overall splits, but below the surface, things felt inconsistent. As with last week's 1Ks, each 800 seem to be split (per 200) as 36-37/40/40/40. Initial 800 in each rep felt smooth, second 800 felt difficult after the 200 @ 5K. Had a stitch and pain in both quadricep tendons that slowly built up rep by rep to the point that I took an untimed break after the 3rd 2K to stretch and grab some electrolytes. Happy with the initial effort, need to continue to try to pace more evenly at HMP/T pace, and a bit concerned about recent inabilities to finish workouts as prescribed."

I think it's a real possibility that I'll have to switch to Thursday/Sunday workouts, especially if work on Wednesdays is going to continue to take so much out of me. Felt sluggish to start (although not 7:53/mile sluggish, not sure what that was about), but was able to wrangle it together towards the end. Hill sprints were hard to accurately time with gloves/touch screen watch in the cold, but the effort felt good. Easier than normal, though - I might've started further down the hill than normal, hence making things easier. Probably should start standardizing a start point."

Took a pause before the strides to consider a few things. I feel like I am running relatively well when I need to run at higher intensities (pacing is still something I need to work on, but it is getting a bit better). The issue now is trying to get the high-intensity work I need in. Another week with a missed workout and less mileage than I wanted - stupidly, I thought I could get my lab work done today and then workout, only to find my lab work taking nearly the entire day to complete.

If I want to run well at Philly at the end of March, I can't keep doing this. I did this last semester, and while it worked for a few non-competitive races throughout the last block, it blew up in my face for the final race that actually matter. No more ""let's see how the semester goes and figure out accordingly"" - here's the plan from here on out:

1. DROP THE NON-ESSENTIALS - they're adding time to my schedule without a purpose, and it's starting to creating backlogs that cause me to be exhausted going into workout days (which lead to the re-arrangements that keep being fruitless). That'll mean resigning from the PST presidency (unfortunate but necessary), dropping hours at my clinical job where I'm not actually being productive (so instead of hanging around until 5 on my Wednesday work/workout days, leaving when I've roomed the last patient and thus finished my job for the day), and scheduling ""fun"" events AROUND my runs, not adjusting my runs for said events.

2.  RUNS BEFORE THE HARD WORK - clearly, trying to get stuff done in my lab and then trying to run isn't working. Either I rush stuff in my lab, or I end up running really late and not getting the runs in when I want to. I'm going to start writing blocks for running into my schedule and forcing myself to get up on days where I will be working in the lab late so that I can get the runs and the work in. That way, less late runs, more sleep, more chances to run during the week and thus get better workouts in (and more easy runs to decrease daily mileage during the week). 

3. BUY-IN ALL THE WAY: doing the strides and hill sprints more regularly is a good start, but I need to stick to the prescribed plan more consistently. No more changing workout days unless absolutely necessary (for example, as much as I want to next week, the chances of me having plans on Valentine's Day are slim anyways so no need to force through a change). Get the lifts in when prescribed (Thursday/Saturday!) and avoid the late, non-prescribed night runs.

No more talking the talk without walking the walk. I will get the Wednesday and Saturday workouts in. I will run Tuesday. I will lift Thursday and Saturday. I will get over 50+ miles for the week. And I will run in a manner best for me. Lock in and lift, Kartik."

200m jog after every 400, 90s standing rest after the 1600 and before the 800. Believe the overall running splits should be ~6 miles in 34:33 (~5:46/mile).

Not sure how to feel about this. First 1600 was way too fast (should have been closer to 5:20 for T pace of 5:20/mile), but opening with a first lap of (16s through 100m, 34s through 200m, and 71s through 400m) was always going to be difficult to wrangle back (even with the next three laps all between 76-78s). First 400 went out way too quick (should have been ~77/78 for 5K pace of 5:09/mile), and while all the 400s were relatively consistent (phone has 71-73s as the spread, though watch had 70-72s during the workout), the 200m jogs got slower and slower (originally 57-58s, peaked at 69s before getting slightly quicker) in order to compensate for a higher pace maintenance for the 400s. Felt OK for about 150m of the last rep (should've been another T mile), but legs (mainly quads) and stomach felt so bad that I called it after 800m (which was run as two laps - watch inadvertently cut the distance short. Actually, as a matter of fact, my watch had me run more than 4 laps for the initial mile and had me start 400s and 200s after the designated lines on the track, so the 800 was the only time I ran based on the lines on the track).

Frustrated that I ran off what was planned (apologies Jacob, you wrote a very nice workout and I feel that I let you down by running like a maniac), especially considering that I switched Thursday and Saturday's workouts to accommodate a late start to tonight's workout. Happy that I somewhat help the pacing together from start to finish, but given that I had to slow down jog reps and turned the last 1600 into an 800, it behooves me to reflect on properly pacing during workouts to ensure I can carry out a prescribed workout to a T. 

Because there's no dropping out during the Love Run. "

Grateful to work with Tim and Nolan through this (though they sent the last steady/moderate section and left me to chase while attempting to maintain a steady/moderate pace).

for those who are curious, the idea is to focus on moving from your elbows and not your hands/wrists with an even carriage. you can think of your arms like those swinging ships at amusement parks that have an even 50/50 swing left and right. you don‚Äôt wanna cross over your body to the other side but it is perfectly acceptable to swing up in front of the body towards the midline. it a important to feel the difference in your back/shoulders, hips, and feet when doing the new way versus your old way. this way you can make that neuromuscular connection and ensure you‚Äôre not falling back to your old way while practicing the cue. if you feel like you‚Äôre transitioning to your old way, don‚Äôt fight it and reset with your old form, then return to the cue shortly after. feel free to DM me if you have any questions! happy to help. also if you do want to work on your form, be sure to video yourself with a friend/tripod and phone on the road and get three clips: one running away from the camera, one towards, and one from the side at around waist level."

Well, that was something üí¶üí¶üí¶üòÇüòÇüòÇ. I literally didn't need hydration. My beard dripping water supplied my nourishment ü§î.  
This was probably worst possible weather. Poured the whole time and tons of road flooding/puddles. On top of that this DEFINITELY was the hardest course I've done. The elevation net was pretty bad 
Felt solid most of race. I got some stomach cramping with 15ish so didn't do gels as planned. The killer in this one was about 9/10 ankle pain from my dumbass tying my shoes to tight. No stopping though.. dang ankle still hurts. If not for that, id say it would have been relatively smooth.
Very happy with result considering weather and course! On a better day, I got a 3:05-07 in me. The winner was about 5 min slower than avg... 
Shout out to Jacob Montgomery . The coach extraordinaire!! Thanks for coming out and all the support. Thanks to Megan Lister for dealing with me and my training... Even more so for dealing with the kids during the weekend race trip! "
