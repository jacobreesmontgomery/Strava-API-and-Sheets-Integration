# Strava-API-and-Sheets-Integration

## Description
This project integrates Google Apps Script with the Strava API to pull my authenticated athlete's activities down. It is all done in Google Apps Script, with the "GOONS" sheet serving as the database and source of truth. Moreover, the athlete sheets and recap sheet use the data from the "GOONS" sheet and athlete sheets, respectively.
